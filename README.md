# powerbi-kickstarter-pack

Welcome to the Sydney Microsoft BizApps Women MeetUp "Goodie Bag"!

We've created this little starter pack to help Power BI "Newbies" familiarse themselves with the functionality available in Power BI.

From this site you will be able to download two templates. One has instructions on how to get started by connecting your Dataverse, the other template is your blank canvas where you can start creating reports for the first time from an existing framework.
